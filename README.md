### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- I encountrered a few troubles running the app, mainly since my XCode is more updated compared to the video, looking for certain icons was a little troublesome. I was also unfamiliar using terminal to navigate to my folder so my fix was opening the terminal through the folder itself using finder. Overall, I learned from my mistakes.
